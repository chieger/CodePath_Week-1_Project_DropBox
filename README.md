##### Hello, I am setup on the observer track for the iOS for designers track. I am a bit unclear as to what the expectations are for observer students as far as subbmitting the weekly assignments, but here it is :)

# CodePath_Week-1_Project_DropBox
codepath Week 1 assignment dropbox

**Time spent: 10+ hours**

#### Completed user stories:
  
  * Required: User can tap through the 3 welcome screens.
  * Required: User can follow the create user flow. *EXCEPT* (had trouble getting the buttons for licence agreement and sign out to performSegueWithIdentifier...worked great for the signed in "need help with password" and "sign out" It's as if there was something different about the create account chain that was permitting segues from being triggered?
  * Required: User can follow the sign in flow.
